1. Introduction
HEN is a smart stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (1 HEN = 1 USD), similar to USDT and DAI, but with a unique feature: daily profit distribution to holders through a staking mechanism for other cryptocurrencies.

2. Core Concept
The key idea behind HEN revolves around:

Dollar-pegged stability to ensure price consistency.

Enabling staking for other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).

Distributing staking rewards daily to HEN holders proportionally based on their holdings.

Metaphorically representing a "golden-egg-laying hen"—users earn passive income while preserving the token’s core value.

3. System Architecture
The HEN ecosystem consists of three main smart contracts:

(1) HEN Token (Main Contract)
Issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum or compatible networks (e.g., BSC, Polygon).

Functions:

Mints and tracks user balances.

Integrates with the stabilization mechanism to maintain the 1:1 USD peg.

Automatically distributes daily staking rewards to holders.

(2) Stabilization Contract (Peg Mechanism)
Ensures HEN remains stable at $1, similar to DAI’s collateral-backed model.

How it works:

Users deposit collateral (e.g., ETH, BTC, USDC).

Collateral allows minting new HEN tokens at a controlled ratio.

Users can burn HEN to reclaim collateral.

Uses an Oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to monitor collateral values and prevent undercollateralization.

(3) Staking & Distribution Pool
Responsibilities:

Accepts HEN deposits from users.

Stakes other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH 2.0, BNB) to generate yields.

Distributes yields daily to HEN holders proportionally.

User benefits:

Earn passive income without locking funds directly in staking.

Withdraw capital + rewards anytime.

4. How Users Earn Rewards
When users hold HEN (in wallets or the staking pool):

A portion of staking yields from other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH staking rewards) is pooled.

Daily rewards are distributed to all HEN holders.

The more HEN a user holds, the larger their share of rewards.

Practical Example:
If 1,000,000 HEN are in circulation and you hold 10,000 HEN (1%), and the staking pool generates

6. Benefits of HEN
Price Stability: Pegged to USD for reliable transactions.

Daily Passive Income: Earn yields without active staking.

No Locking Required: Rewards accumulate even in wallets.

Diversified Earnings: Functions as interest-bearing savings instead of idle assets.
