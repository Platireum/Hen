1. Introduction
{
  "title": "HEN: The Smart Stablecoin with Daily Staking Rewards",
  "description": "HEN is a smart stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (1 HEN = 1 USD), similar to USDT and DAI, but with a unique feature: daily profit distribution to holders through a staking mechanism for other cryptocurrencies."
}

2. Core Concept
{
  "key_idea": [
    "Dollar-pegged stability to ensure price consistency.",
    "Enabling staking for other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).",
    "Distributing staking rewards daily to HEN holders proportionally based on their holdings."
  ],
  "metaphor": "Metaphorically representing a 'golden-egg-laying hen'—users earn passive income while preserving the token’s core value."
}

3. System Architecture
{
  "contracts": [
    {
      "name": "HEN Token (Main Contract)",
      "type": "ERC-20 token",
      "networks": ["Ethereum", "BSC", "Polygon"],
      "functions": [
        "Mints and tracks user balances.",
        "Integrates with the stabilization mechanism to maintain the 1:1 USD peg.",
        "Automatically distributes daily staking rewards to holders."
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Stabilization Contract (Peg Mechanism)",
      "purpose": "Ensures HEN remains stable at $1, similar to DAI’s collateral-backed model.",
      "mechanism": {
        "deposit_collateral": "Users deposit collateral (e.g., ETH, BTC, USDC).",
        "minting": "Collateral allows minting new HEN tokens at a controlled ratio.",
        "burning": "Users can burn HEN to reclaim collateral.",
        "oracle": "Uses an Oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to monitor collateral values and prevent undercollateralization."
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Staking & Distribution Pool",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Accepts HEN deposits from users.",
        "Stakes other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH 2.0, BNB) to generate yields.",
        "Distributes yields daily to HEN holders proportionally."
      ],
      "user_benefits": [
        "Earn passive income without locking funds directly in staking.",
        "Withdraw capital + rewards anytime."
      ]
    }
  ]
}

4. How Users Earn Rewards
{
  "process": "When users hold HEN (in wallets or the staking pool): A portion of staking yields from other cryptocurrencies (e.g., ETH staking rewards) is pooled. Daily rewards are distributed to all HEN holders. The more HEN a user holds, the larger their share of rewards.",
  "example": {
    "total_hen_circulation": 1000000,
    "user_hen_holding": 10000,
    "user_holding_percentage": "1%",
    "daily_staking_pool_yield": 1000,
    "user_daily_earnings": 10
  }
}

5. HEN vs. Other Stablecoins (USDT, DAI)
{
  "comparison": [
    {
      "feature": "Dollar Peg",
      "USDT/DAI": "Yes",
      "HEN": "Yes"
    },
    {
      "feature": "Staking Support",
      "USDT/DAI": "No",
      "HEN": "Yes (with daily rewards)"
    },
    {
      "feature": "Holder Rewards",
      "USDT/DAI": "No",
      "HEN": "Yes (daily distribution)"
    },
    {
      "feature": "Collateral",
      "USDT": "Cash/Bank Reserves",
      "DAI": "Diversified (Crypto Assets)",
      "HEN": "Diversified (Crypto Assets)"
    }
  ]
}

6. Benefits of HEN
{
  "benefits": [
    "Price Stability: Pegged to USD for reliable transactions.",
    "Daily Passive Income: Earn yields without active staking.",
    "No Locking Required: Rewards accumulate even in wallets.",
    "Diversified Earnings: Functions as interest-bearing savings instead of idle assets."
  ]
}

7. Potential Challenges
{
  "challenges": [
    "Oracle Reliance: Requires secure price feeds to prevent exploits.",
    "Collateral Management: Must maintain sufficient reserves for redemptions.",
    "Competition: Needs robust security and usability to stand out among stablecoins."
  ]
}

8. Conclusion
{
  "summary": "HEN merges stablecoin reliability with staking rewards, appealing to users who want: Value preservation (via USD peg), Daily passive income with minimal risk, Simplified staking with automated
